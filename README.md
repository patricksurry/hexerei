Hex and counter AI
===

    hexerei - the art or power of bringing magical or preternatural power to bear or the act or practice of attempting to do so

  -     make a blog visual test page that shows labeling and various tests


geojson.io - mapbox open source geojson editor
geojson.xyz - sample files via natural earth
geonmaes.org - collection of mostly points for many features
geoman.io - alternative freemium geojson editor


Map spec
---

geojson => hex map

specials:

Geometry Line with id='origin' with hex side length = pointy radius,
and direction 90deg right of 'up' orientation,
or Point with properties 'scale' hex size in km, and orient=degrees default 0
default flat top, optional pointy=true.

Polygon (or multipolygon) geometry with id='boundary'

other features optional property map='tile|edge|vertex|none', default tile
optional property label=str



coordinate systems:

[web mercator][webgm]for geojson e.g. for map background tiles or cities
[webgm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection

cube/axial coordinates as native hex coords

user coords (string ids) like offset xxyy "0304" or alternative axial like "AA01"
needs a cube2id and id2cube method

map geojson objects to hex tiles, edges and/or vertices  via shapely


build and run like

npx tsc
node --es-module-specifier-resolution=node  dist/flowsnake.js

use directed edge identifiers between two hexes to represent flow between them?
